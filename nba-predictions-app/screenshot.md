# Screenshot Instructions

To add a screenshot of your NBA Predictions App to the README:

1. Take a screenshot of your application when it's running
2. Save the image as `screenshot.png` in the root of your repository
3. Push the screenshot to GitHub with your code
4. The README will automatically display the screenshot

Example commands:
```bash
# After taking a screenshot and saving it to the project root
git add screenshot.png
git commit -m "Add application screenshot for README"
git push
```

This will make your README much more visually appealing and give users an immediate understanding of what your application looks like.
